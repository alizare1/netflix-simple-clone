# Netflix Simple Clone
This project was the last assignment of Advanced Programming course at University of Tehran.
Assignment had two main phases: The [first phase](https://github.com/alizare1/netflix-simple-clone/tree/b8642004f4bd6115f8a20d7b380fa8b2d2bba9d6) was to create this network for command line, with a simple Recommender System based on a graph. In second phase, the network should run on a server using [APHTTP](https://github.com/UTAP/APHTTP) framework.

In the network users can either login or signup. In signup page user can choose to be a publisher.
Publishers can create new films and users who have enough credit can buy them. Users also can rate films and comment on them.

## How to run 
After compiling using the makefile just execute the program.

```bash
./myserver.out
```
